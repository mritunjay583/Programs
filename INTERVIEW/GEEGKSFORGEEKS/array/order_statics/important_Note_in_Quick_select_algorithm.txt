Now lets discuss the efficency of Quick select algorithm
or can say Quick partition algorithm

-->> its average case and best case complexity is O(n)
-->> but it can peform worst with runtime O(n*n)
    
    ->reason

    --> it fails, because of wrong selection of pivot element
        so always try to choose pivot randomly .
        the probablity of getting bad pivot will be very low if you 
        choose pivot randomly and your algorithm will run in best/average
        case
    
    -->> what is wrong pivot ???
        -->>if the choosen pivot is smallest/largest of the list elements
    
    SO,
    -->> what is good pivot ???
        -->>if the choosen pivot is median of the list elements

-->> but your problem is not resolved yet.
    -->>Quick select will also perform worst even you do random selection of 
        pivot .

        REASON

    -->>if number of distinct elements
        in list is very less as compared to size of the list
    
        SOLUTION
    -->the solution for this is to use 3- way - partition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
    so overall best Quick partition algorithm will be

3 - way - partition  +  random pivot selection
