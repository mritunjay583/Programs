--> stair case when order does not matter and coin change are same problem
  --> but solving staircase problem in which order doesnot matter
        will give segmentation fault when number of stairs goes to 10^6

    

--> 0/1 knapsack problem and subset sum are the same problem   
    you can solve both problem in same ways
    differnce is you have given extra weight array
    and in subset sum you have given weight array implicitly in form of
    array elemnts

    -->> in 0/1 knapsack weight is constraint
    and in subset sum given sum is constraint

--> coin change and 0/1 knapsack can be same problem but in 0/1
    knapsack you can take any elemnt atmost most but in coinchange
    you can consider any element any number of time


-->> 0/1 knapsack and cutting rod problem are same 
   -->> the only differnce is you can take any item any number of time
   in cutting rod and your final weight must be W ;
   but in 0/1 knapsack you can take any element atmost once and and
   find weight <=w , it  is not manditory that weight must be eual to W;
